"""Builds the gameplay sprite tiles from ONE image: levels/chr_data/sprite_tiles.png.

    python tools/build_sprite_tiles.py

The image is laid out like sprite VRAM in 8x16 mode: every cell is one tile pair
(tile 2n on top of tile 2n+1), 16 pairs per 16 px row. The grey level of a pixel is its
Game Boy colour index (white = 0, light grey = 1, dark grey = 2, black = 3).

    pair rows  0-7   VRAM bank 0 sprite tiles 0..255 (DMG and CGB). Tiles 8..11 (old ship art, a
                     copy of the neutral ship frame at 48..51) and 12..19 (ball, loaded to 8..11
                     by LOADS) are not loaded: VRAM tiles 12..19 are free
    pair rows  8-15  CGB VRAM bank 1 sprite tiles 0..255
    pair rows 16-17  DECO_CLOUD: bank 1 tiles 160..199 in levels with Famidash's
                     cloud decorations (Xstep, Clutterfunk)
    pair row  18     CGB_MIRROR_EXIT: CGB version of bank 0 tiles 224..239 (mirror exit
                     portal drawn with colour 3 instead of 2: both mirror portals share
                     sprite palette 6, palette 7 is the HUD text palette)

Decorations (CGB_DECO, CGB_DECO_CLOUD, ROD_PULSE) are drawn in the player's sprite palette 0, so
in the cube's colour 1: their colour 1 (black) is loaded as colour 3 (black in that palette).

ROD_PULSE (generated, not in the image): the rods' (Famidash "lights") ball tops, deco pairs
D_C9 / D_CB / D_CD (bank 1 pairs 81..83), with a 5 px and a 3 px ball instead of the 7 px one:
CGB bank 1 tiles 222..233 (5 px: 222..227, 3 px: 228..233). sp_draw.c shows them between the
music's hits (src/music/music_beats.c), so the balls pulse to the music like GD's pulse rods.

Only the ranges in LOADS are loaded; the other slots are empty in the image because
gameplay fills them from the font at runtime ("PAUSED" 76..87, debug HUD and % 90..115)
or they are background tiles (bank 0 128..159; DMG coins use 144..159), or the coin
(levels/chr_data/coin.chr, tools/make_coin_tiles.py).
