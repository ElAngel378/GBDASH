"""Beat timelines of the songs, for the pulsing rods (GD's pulse rods: their balls swell to the
music).

    python tools/make_music_beats.py

Plays every song of src/music/*.c through on paper like hUGEDriver does (Fxx speed, Dxx
pattern break to row xx - 1 of the next order (D00: none), Bxx jump to order xx - 1 (B00: the
next order), after the last order back to order 0, where the game stops the level songs: main.c
step_music; the timeline loops when the song gets back to a row it already played) and lists its hits in driver ticks (hUGE_dosound calls,
counted by step_music in main.c) on the noise channel (drums): a strong hit on a beat (every 4th
row of a pattern) or with the song's kick (its lowest drum note in common use), a weak one
otherwise (hi-hats and the like).

Writes src/music/music_beats.c (bank 65: the timelines and music_beats_start / music_beats_poll)
